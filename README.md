To download attachment from email

Hi @adityaSTL here

This code is used to automatically download attachments from last 15 emails where date is today()

To ensure its working kindly do these things before running otherwise it wont work:
1. IMAP is enabled. 
Check for it in settings in gmail -> all settings -> POP/IMAP Download -> Enable IMAP

2. Generate app password for gmail.
How? manage my google account -> security -> generate app password -> sign in -> mail & windows machine -> copy and store somewhere the paswd

Scripts should run fine.
